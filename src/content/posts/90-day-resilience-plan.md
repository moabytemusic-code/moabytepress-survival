## The Clock is Ticking

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. But panic-planting leads to failure.

Here is a simplified 90-day execution plan.

### Month 1: Foundation (Current Status: Vulnerable)
- **Week 1:** Secure your ground. Tarp the lawn to kill grass (occultation) or build raised beds.
- **Week 2:** Source dirt. Buy bulk compost/soil mix. Don't dig up clay and expect miracles.
- **Week 3:** Buy seeds. Focus on the [Big 5 Calories](/blog/high-calorie-crops). Get potato tubers ordered.
- **Week 4:** Water plan. Install one rain barrel or identify your outdoor spigot strategy.

### Month 2: Production (Current Status: Active)
- **Week 5:** Planting. Potatoes go in. Peas/Beans go in.
- **Week 6:** Pest defense. Install fencing (deer/rabbits). They are hungry too.
- **Week 7:** Successional Sowing. Plant a second round of radishes/lettuce for quick wins while waiting for big crops.
- **Week 8:** Fertilizer. Apply organic fish emulsion or compost tea.

### Month 3: Expansion (Current Status: Resilient)
- **Week 9:** Trellising. Support the climbing beans and tomatoes.
- **Week 10:** Scout for pests daily. Hand-pick beetles.
- **Week 11:** First Harvests (radishes, greens). Morale boost.
- **Week 12:** Plan the Fall Garden. Resilience is a cycle.
