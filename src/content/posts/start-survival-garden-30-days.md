## The 30-Day Sprint

Most people procrastinate because they think they need a "perfect" plan. In a survival scenario, speed matters more than perfection.

### Week 1: Site Selection & Prep
- **Analyze Sun:** You need 6-8 hours of direct light for calories (potatoes/corn). Leafy greens can take shade, but they won't keep you alive.
- **Kill the Grass:** Don't till. Tilling wakes up weed seeds. Use "sheet mulching": lay down cardboard over the grass, wet it, and cover with 4 inches of compost/soil.
- **Secure Water:** Locate your spigots. Buy two 50ft hoses. If the grid is down, where is the water coming from? (See our [Off-Grid Watering](/blog/off-grid-watering-systems) guide).

### Week 2: Soil & Fertility
- **Import Calories:** If your soil is poor, buy bulk compost. It's the only shortcut that works.
- **Amendments:** Add bone meal (phosphorus) for roots and blood meal (nitrogen) for growth.
- **Build Beds:** If using raised beds, construct them now. 4ft wide by 8ft long is standard.

### Week 3: Planting the Core
- **Potatoes:** Plant them deep (6 inches).
- **Beans:** Direct sow pole beans.
- **Corn:** Plant in blocks (3x3 minimum), not long rows, for pollination.
- **Squash:** Mounds of 3 seeds each.

### Week 4: Systems Check
- **Fencing:** If you don't fence it, the deer will eat it. Wireless electric fences or 7ft deer netting.
- **Pest Patrol:** Start your daily walk. Look for beetle eggs under leaves.
- **Log It:** Start a notebook. Record what you planted and where.
