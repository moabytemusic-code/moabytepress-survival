## The Urban Survivalist's Advantage

You might envy the homesteader with 50 acres, but small spaces have advantages: control. You can control the soil, the water, and the security much easier in a 500 sq ft backyard than a sprawling field.

### Vertical is Mandatory

When horizontal space is limited, you must go up.
- **Trellising:** Pole beans, cucumbers, and even small melons can be grown on cattle panels or heavy-duty netting.
- **Tower Gardens:** Commercially available or DIY PVC towers allow you to grow 50+ plants in 4 square feet. Ideally suited for greens and strawberries.

### Container Calorie Production

Can you grow calories in pots? Yes.
- **Potatoes in Grow Bags:** 5-gallon fabric pots are perfect. Easy to harvest—just dump them out.
- **Sweet Potatoes:** Excellent for containers; just ensure they have room for the vines to run or trellis them.

### Square Foot Gardening

The classic Mel Bartholomew method is critical here.
- Densely planted raised beds.
- Interplanting fast crops (radishes) with slow crops (corn).

### Security
Small, hidden gardens are less of a target. A vertical wall of beans looks like a privacy screen, not a food source. Use this to your advantage.
