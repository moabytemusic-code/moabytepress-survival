## The Hard Truth About Your Garden

Navigate to any gardening forum, and you'll see endless photos of lush tomatoes, crisp lettuce, and colorful peppers. These are beautiful. They are delicious. But in a survival scenario, they are a distraction.

**A survival garden has one primary metric: Calories per square foot.**

You cannot starve on a diet of potatoes and beans. You will starve on a diet of salad greens.

### The Problem With "Hobby" Crops

Hobby gardening focuses on:
- Variety and flavor
- Aesthetics
- Nutrients (vitamins) over energy

Survival gardening must focus on:
- Caloric density
- Storage capability
- Reliability and seed saving

### The Calorie Math

Let's look at the numbers.
- **Leafy Greens:** Approx 100 calories per pound.
- **Potatoes:** Approx 350 calories per pound.
- **Corn/Grains:** Approx 1,600 calories per pound (dry).
- **Dry Beans:** Approx 1,500 calories per pound.

If you have limited space, dedicating 40% of it to kale is a tactical failure.

### What You Should Grow

1. **Potatoes:** The ultimate survival crop. High yield, stores well in-ground or root cellar.
2. **Corn (Flint/Dent):** For meal and flour, not sweet corn. High energy density.
3. **Dry Beans:** Protein and longevity.
4. **Winter Squash:** Long shelf life, vitamins, and decent calories.
