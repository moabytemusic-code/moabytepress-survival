## The Urban Survivalist's Advantage

You might envy the homesteader with 50 acres, but small spaces have advantages: control. You can control the soil, the water, and the security much easier in a 500 sq ft patio.

### Grow Bags are Essential

Unlike rigid pots, fabric grow bags air-prune roots, preventing root-bound plants.
- **5-Gallon Bags:** Perfect for peppers, determinate tomatoes, and bush beans.
- **10-Gallon Bags:** Ideal for potatoes (hill them up as they grow).
- **20-Gallon Bags:** Small fruit trees or a "Three Sisters" mini-guild.

### Vertical is Mandatory

When horizontal space is limited, you must go up.
- **Trellising:** Pole beans can climb a simple string or bamboo teepee in a pot.
- **Tower Gardens:** Commercially available or DIY PVC towers allow you to grow 50+ plants in 4 square feet. Ideally suited for greens and strawberries.

### Calorie Focus

Can you grow calories in pots? Yes.
- **Potatoes:** Dump the bag to harvest. No digging.
- **Sweet Potatoes:** Vines tolerate heat and containers well.

### Security
Small, hidden gardens are less of a target. A vertical wall of beans looks like a privacy screen, not a food source. Use this to your advantage.
