## The Portable Calorie Factory

If you are in an apartment, rented house, or urban lot with contaminated soil, growing in the ground isn't an option. But you still need calories.

Enter the **5-Gallon Bucket Potato System**.

Potatoes provide more calories per square foot and more nutrients per acre than almost any other staple crop. And they love buckets.

### Why Grade-A Potato Buckets?

1.  **Portability:** If you have to bug out or move, your garden moves with you.
2.  **Density:** You can fit 4 buckets in 4 square feet.
3.  **Control:** No pests (voles/gophers cannot eat your tubers). Perfect soil drainage.
4.  **Harvest:** No digging. Just dump the bucket.

### The Setup (Step-by-Step)

#### 1. The Bucket
Get food-grade 5-gallon buckets (bakeries often give them away).
*   **Drill Drainage:** This is non-negotiable. Drill ten 1/2-inch holes in the bottom. Potatoes will rot instantly in standing water.

#### 2. The Soil Mix
Do not use dirt from the yard. It compacts in containers.
*   **Mix:** 1/3 Compost + 1/3 Peat Moss (or Coco Coir) + 1/3 Perlite/Vermiculite.
*   **Fertility:** Mix in a handful of bone meal (phosphorus) for tuber growth.

#### 3. The Seed Potato
*   Buy certified seed potatoes (or organic store-bought that have sprouted).
*   Cut large potatoes into chunks with at least 2 "eyes." Let them cure (scab over) for 24 hours before planting.

#### 4. The Planting Strategy
1.  Fill the bucket with **4 inches** of soil mix.
2.  Place 2 seed potato chunks on top.
3.  Cover with **3 inches** of soil. Water well.
4.  **Hilling:** As the green plant grows up, keep adding more soil mix until the bucket is full. This encourages tubers to form all along the buried stem.

### Expected Yields

In a well-managed bucket system:
*   **Yield:** 2 to 4 lbs of potatoes per bucket.
*   **Calorie Math:** 20 buckets = ~60-80 lbs of potatoes. That is roughly **25,000 to 30,000 calories**.

That is two weeks of complete caloric survival for one adult, grown on a balcony.

### Varieties Matter
*   **Determinates (Yukon Gold):** Grow fast, set fruit all at once. Good for short seasons.
*   **Indeterminates (Russet):** Keep growing upward. Better for the "hilling" method in tall containers.

### Start Building Your Survival Food System

A stack of buckets is the fastest way to start your calorie production. But you need a schedule.
