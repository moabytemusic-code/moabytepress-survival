## Water is Heavy

A gallon of water weighs 8.3 lbs. A mature garden needs hundreds of gallons a week in summer. Hauling that by hand is a calorie-negative activity. You need systems that move water for you.

### 1. Rain Catchment

The roof of your house is a massive collector.
- 1 inch of rain on a 1,000 sq ft roof = ~600 gallons.
- Divert gutters into IBC totes or food-grade barrels.
- **Note:** Elevate your tanks. Gravity is your pump.

### 2. Ollas (Buried Clay Pots)

An ancient technique. Bury an unglazed clay pot next to your plants. Fill it with water. The water seeps through the clay only as the soil dries out.
- Zero evaporation loss.
- Roots grow directly to the pot.
- Saves 50-70% of water compared to surface watering.

### 3. Swales and Earthworks

Dig ditches (swales) on contour (level lines) across your slope. When it rains, water fills the trench and sinks into the ground instead of running off. This hydrates the landscape deeply, reducing the need for irrigation weeks later.

**Tactical Tip:** Mulch heavily. Bare soil is dead soil. 4 inches of straw or wood chips retains moisture like a sponge.
