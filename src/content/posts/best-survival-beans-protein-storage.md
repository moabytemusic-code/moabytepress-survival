## The Meat Alternative

In a grid-down scenario, the freezer thaws in 48 hours. The meat is gone. Hunting is unreliable and energy-intensive.

Your protein must come from the garden. And **dry beans** are the king of vegetable protein.

Unlike green beans (Snap beans), which are mostly water and fiber, dry beans are dense energy. They store indefinitely without electricity.

But not all beans are created equal. You need varieties that are:
1.  **Productive** (High yield).
2.  **Resilient** (Drought/disease resistant).
3.  **Versatile** (Good for soup/stew).

### 1. The Pinto Bean (Pole Variety)

The workhorse of the Americas.
*   **Why:** High protein (15g per cup cooked). Creamy texture.
*   **Grow:** Choose pole varieties over bush. Pole beans produce vertical yield over a longer season.
*   **Tactical Advantage:** Camouflage. A wall of pinto beans looks like a mess of vines, hiding the valuable protein pods underneath.

### 2. Cherokee Trail of Tears (Pole Black Bean)

An heirloom with history. This bean survived the Trail of Tears, proving its resilience.
*   **Why:** Incredibly prolific. The pods start green (edible snap beans) and dry to a shiny black bean.
*   **Flavor:** Rich, meaty flavor perfect for black bean soup and rice.
*   **Resilience:** Tolerates heat and poor soil better than most modern varieties.

### 3. Scarlet Runner Bean

The perennial powerhouse (in mild climates).
*   **Why:** Massive beans. Massive vines.
*   **Edibility:** You can eat the young pods, the fresh shelled beans, and the dry beans. Even the flowers and starchy roots are edible.
*   **Pollinators:** The bright red flowers attract pollinators to your garden, boosting your squash and cucumber yields.
*   **Cold Tolerance:** Handles cool weather better than common beans.

### How to Store Them

Harvest when the pods are brown and crispy. The bean inside should be rock hard (you can't dent it with a fingernail).
1.  **Shell:** Remove from pods.
2.  **Freeze (Optional):** Freeze for 48 hours to kill weevil eggs (critical step).
3.  **Seal:** Store in Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers or masonry jars.
4.  **Shelf Life:** 10+ years.
