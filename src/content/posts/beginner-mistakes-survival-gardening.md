## Failure is Expensive

In a hobby garden, failure is annoying. In a survival garden, failure is hunger. Here are the most common mistakes we see.

### 1. Planting Too Much, Too Soon
**The Mistake:** Tilling up 1,000 sq ft and planting it all in one weekend.
**The Reality:** By July, the weeds will overwhelm you. You will burn out.
**The Fix:** Start with 100 sq ft. Master it. Then expand.

### 2. Ignoring Water Access
**The Mistake:** Planting at the back of the property, 200ft from the nearest hose.
**The Reality:** You won't carry buckets that far daily. The plants will die.
**The Fix:** Gardens go where the water is.

### 3. Mono-Cropping Without Rotation
**The Mistake:** Planting potatoes in the same spot every year.
**The Reality:** Creating a buffet for potato beetles and blights.
**The Fix:** Rotate crops. Legumes (beans) fix nitrogen. Roots (potatoes) eat nitrogen. Swap them yearly.

### 4. Buying Hybrid Seeds
**The Mistake:** Buying cheap seeds from the dollar store.
**The Reality:** They are likely F1 hybrids. You cannot save seeds from them. You are dependent on the store.
**The Fix:** Buy "Open-Pollinated" or "Heirloom" seeds only.

### 5. Harvest Waste
**The Mistake:** Growing 500 lbs of zucchini with no canning jars.
**The Reality:** It rots on the counter.
**The Fix:** Buy your canning jars and pressure canner *before* you plant the seeds.
