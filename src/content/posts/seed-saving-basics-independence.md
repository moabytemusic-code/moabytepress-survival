## The Supply Chain Weakness

In 2020, seed companies ran out of stock. It happened fast. If you rely on a packet from the store to eat, you are vulnerable.

### Hybrid vs. Open-Pollinated

- **Hybrid (F1):** Great vigor, but the seeds you save will not breed true. They might be sterile or produce weird variants. Avoid for survival.
- **Open-Pollinated / Heirloom:** These plants have stable genetics. If you save seeds from a 'Brandywine' tomato, next year's plant will be a 'Brandywine' tomato.

**Rule #1:** Buy only Heirloom or Open-Pollinated seeds for your core survival crops.

### Easiest Seeds to Start With

1. **Beans & Peas:** They self-pollinate. Just let a few pods dry brown on the vine until the beans rattle. Shell them and store them.
2. **Tomatoes:** Generally self-pollinating. Squeeze seeds into a jar, ferment for 3 days to remove the gel sack, rinse, and dry.
3. **Lettuce:** Let it bolt (flower). Shake the fluffy seeds into a bag.

### Storage
Cool, Dark, Dry.
Moisture is the enemy. Use mason jars with silica gel packets in a cool closet or fridge.

Start your bank today. A single bean can produce 50 more. That is leverage.
