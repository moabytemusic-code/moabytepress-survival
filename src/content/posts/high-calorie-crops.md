## The Big Three + Two

If you had to feed your family from your backyard, what would you plant? If you say "tomatoes and cucumbers," you need to rethink your strategy.

To survive, an active adult needs approximately 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day. That is roughly **730,000 to 912,500 calories per year**.

You aren't getting that from zucchini.

### 1. Potatoes
Potatoes are the cornerstone. In good soil, you can get 2-5 lbs of potatoes per plant. They require no processing to eat (just heat), and they grow in marginal soils.

### 2. Grain Corn
Forget sweet corn. You want Dent corn or Flint corn. These varieties dry down on the stalk and can be ground into cornmeal or flour. They store for years.

### 3. Dry Beans
Pole beans maximize vertical space. Favorites like 'Cherokee Trail of Tears' or 'Pinto' beans provide essential protein and pair perfectly with corn for a complete amino acid profile.

### 4. Winter Squash
Hubbard, Butternut, and Acorn squash can sit on a shelf at room temperature for months. They are dense, filling, and packed with Vitamin A.

### 5. Sunflowers (Oilseed)
Often overlooked, oilseed sunflowers provide massive fat content—energy that is hard to get from roots and greens. Plus, the seeds are easy to harvest.

### The Strategy
dedicate 80% of your growing space to these five crops. The remaining 20% can be for vitamins (kale, peppers, medical herbs) and flavor.

Make the shift this season.
