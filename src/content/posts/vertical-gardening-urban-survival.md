## The Urban Advantage

Cities are heat islands, which means you have a longer growing season. But space is your enemy. Vertical gardening isn't just aesthetic—it's a survival multiplier.

### 1. Cattle Panel Arches
The most robust system. Bend a 16ft cattle panel ($30) into an arch between two raised beds.
- **Grow:** Pole beans, cucumbers, small melons, and squash.
- **Yield:** Increases grow space by 300% for the same footprint.

### 2. Greenstalks & Towers
Vertical hydroponic or soil-based towers.
- **Best for:** Leafy greens, strawberries, herbs, and dwarf bush beans.
- **Warning:** These dry out fast. In a grid-down summer, they need daily manual watering.

### 3. Pallet Walls
Free but labor-intensive. Staple landscape fabric to the back of a heat-treated (HT) pallet. Fill with soil. Lean against a south-facing wall.
- **Grow:** Shallow-rooted crops like lettuces, radishes, and herbs.

### 4. The "Three Sisters" Stack
The original vertical garden.
- **Corn:** Acts as the trellis.
- **Beans:** Climb the corn.
- **Squash:** Covers the ground (living mulch).

**Tactical Note:** Vertical gardens are more visible. If OPSEC (Operational Security) is a concern, keep your vertical structures below the fence line.
