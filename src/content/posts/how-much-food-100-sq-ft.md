## The 10x10 Challenge

A 100 square foot plot (10x10) is a standard beginner garden size. But is it enough?

### The Calorie Math

Total Annual Calorie Need (1 Adult): ~800,000 calories.

**Scenario A: "Salad Garden" (Tomato, Lettuce, Peppers)**
- Yield: ~150 lbs of food.
- Calories: ~25,000 calories total.
- **Result:** You starve in 12 days.

**Scenario B: "Survival Garden" (Potatoes, Corn, Beans)**
- **Potatoes (50 sq ft):** Closely spaced. Yield: ~100 lbs = 35,000 calories.
- **Corn/Beans Interplanted (50 sq ft):** Yield: ~10 lbs dry corn + 5 lbs dry beans = 25,000 calories.
- **Total:** ~60,000 calories.
- **Result:** You survive for **30 days**.

### The Verdict

**100 square feet feeds one adult for one month.**

To feed yourself for a year, you need approximately **1,200 to 2,000 square feet** of bio-intensive production (roughly 1/20th of an acre).

### How to Scale
1. **Start Small:** Master the 100 sq ft first.
2. **Expand:** Add 100 sq ft every season.
3. **Preserve:** You can't eat it all at once. You must have a storage plan.

Don't have 2,000 sq ft? You need to focus on **storage** and **barter** crops, not just production.
